                    <p>Greetings, Bathtime Land. It's your heinousness speaking, The Rubber Ducky King. I just put an album out on SoundCloud. I call this one "Venues: stores with loud merchandise!" I'm unsure if it deserved the "!"; I'm hardly a George Michael. WHAM! I wanted to link it to my Instagram, but to my surprise, the linking service I was using got eaten by a bigger linking service fish. I shall not name name. It was LinkTree. So I thought I should just make a personal website at this point. SHABOOYAH. WASUP PLANET EARTH. JACOB'S JOCULAR MIDDLE NAME' PELLECHIA COMING AT YOU LIVE FROM THE WEB. Thx GitHub. I may soon put the album on other streaming platforms later, but for now, it's just SoundCloud. It's like slower, acoustic, indie rock stuff. I think a good amount of it is quite pretty, but I've been recently making more straight-up pop/rock. Ok. End of blog post.</p>
