                <h2>Who is this luciously locked, ethnically ambiguous, scholar of excellence?</h2>
                <p>Jacob is a Virginia-born musician and software engineer, currently enrolled at Oberlin College. There, he studies computer science, mathematics, and jazz guitar.</p>
                <p>On this page, you'll find all of his schemes. One of his computer programs is called MusicTranscriber, a program that will turn a single audio file into single-instrument-separated midi files and audio files. You can also find his plethora of original music.</p>
